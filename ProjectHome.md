## Application generates blank Joomla extension. ##

You can zip it and install successfully on your Joomla installation for further development. It may save your time by eliminating preparing and testing effort for creating your extensions 'canvas'.

Tool for Joomla! developers . I hope you will see how it will save your time to prepare blank component. When you start the application, enter some basic information about it and about the author, and then point to the place where  the  folder with file structure will be created. Just archive a directory (as a ZIP file) and it is ready for installation in Joomla! After installation is done in your dev Joomla! you can take right away for programming, instead of building a blank component and be distracting by potential errors.

To generate a ready to install Joomla component items do:
  1. download and run the generator from the repository project http://code.google.com/p/joomla-blank-extension-generator/
  1. enter data about the component and its author
  1. click save and choose where you create a directory file structure component
  1. archive folder (as a ZIP file) and install the component in your Joomla! (via back-end panel)

Planned features:
  * Automatic zipping directory
  * Tab module allows the generation of the module installer with the ability to insert HTML content
